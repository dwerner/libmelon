# Melon Libraries #

An actor model library in plain C.

This is a bit of a play-project, meant to be a return to OOP-style C (C11 in this case). It represents my forays into developing a coherent style in C, learning pthreads, and developing my own datastructures to represent the library's primitives.

# Build instructions

`mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make`

Should compile on most linux systems with gcc installed. Dependency on pthreads and check
